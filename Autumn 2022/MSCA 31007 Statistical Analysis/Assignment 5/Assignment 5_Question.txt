Download your sample from left sidebar, unpack and read it.

Create variable dataPath equal to path to your local folder where you saved the data file Week5_Test_Sample.csv.
It should look like:

dataPath<-"C:/Your path"
Note that in R path is specified with forward slash “/”. Do not end the path with / when you assign dataPath.

Read the data.

dat <- read.table(paste(dataPath,'Week5_Test_Sample.csv',sep = '/'), header=TRUE)
The sample dat has the following format:

dat$Output - output Y values;
dat$Input - predictor X values.
Fit linear model GeneralModel, analyze residuals and separate the mixed models. Fit separate linear models mSteep and mFlat. Variables GeneralModel,mSteep and mFlat are objects of class “lm”. Create list variable resand save it in file result.rds. .


res <- list( GeneralModel = GeneralModel,mSteep = mSteep,mFlat = mFlat)
Save res to a file and upload the file using left sidebar.

saveRDS(res, file = paste(dataPath,'result.rds',sep = '/'))
