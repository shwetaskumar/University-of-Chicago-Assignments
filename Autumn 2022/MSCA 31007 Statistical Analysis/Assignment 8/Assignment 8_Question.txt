Assignment
Download your personal sample from left sidebar, unpack and read it:

dataPath <- "C:/path_to_your_dir/"
test_dat <- read.table(paste(dataPath,'Week8_Test_Sample.csv',sep = '/'), header=TRUE)
The sample test_dat has the following format:

test_dat$Output - output values;
test_dat$Treatment - predictor values;
Fit the data with models lm(Output ~ Treatment) and lm(Output~Treatement-1).

Calculate ANOVA tables necessary for answering questions of the quiz. Answer the questions.

You can also see in the interactive tab how between the groups variation and within the groups variation change when you change coefficients of the model.


QUIZ:
Fill text fields and choose correct answer:

1) Within group sum of squares:

2) Between groups sum of squares

3) Conclusion of utility test:
	All group means are the same
	Not all group means are the same
4) Sum of squares of predictor for the model testing H0:
 "all group mean values equal to zero"

5) Sum of squares of residuals for the model testing H0:
 "all group mean values equal to zero""

6) What is the conclusion about equality of all group mean values to zero?
	All group mean values equal to zero
	Not all group mean values equal to zero
