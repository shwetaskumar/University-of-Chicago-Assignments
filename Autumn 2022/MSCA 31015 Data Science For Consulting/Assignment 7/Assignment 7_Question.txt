Module 7 â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection

Predictive Model Exercise: 

Using:

the datasets FraudTrain.csv and FraudTest.csv

Python Notebook file credit-card-fraud-detection-models.ipynb

and the background training video:

Calculate basic stats descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for each field 
Visualize distributions of data elements using histograms for key variables and predict which variables you expect to be most correlated with default/churn. 
Insert (or use code provided) appropriate code to evaluate the credit card fraud detection performance of Decision Trees and Random Forest
Display the output visually using charts of your choosing and explain your choice. (ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Gains Table) 
In addition to the spreadsheet/code or programming output you submit, include a separate written document of 250-500 words that summarizes:
a) your interpretation of the data via the Exploratory data analysis

b) your interpretation  of modeling output of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest

c) discuss which variables are most significant and any other unexpected insights.

This assignment is designed to expose you to models and tools the more advanced analyst uses to predict and develop business cases for action. You may need help from a tutor or by watching videos to understand enough to build interpret the decision tree and random forest models.
