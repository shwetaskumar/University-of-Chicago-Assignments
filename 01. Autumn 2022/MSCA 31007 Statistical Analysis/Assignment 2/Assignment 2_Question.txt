Download your personal sample from left sidebar, unpack and read it:

dataPath <- "C:/path_to_your_dir/"
df <- read.table(paste0(dataPath, 'sample.csv'), header=TRUE)
The data sample contains 2 columns of variables: predictor df$x and response df$y.

Calculate standard deviations of df$x and df$y and their correlation coefficient. Round all values to the second decimal and use them to calculate the slope a
 without fitting linear model to the data`.

Leave a
 not rounded. Its value will be checked up to the 3 decimal places.

Create variables:

sdX - Standard deviation of df$x
sdY - Standard deviation of df$y
cXY - Correlation coefficient of df$x and df$y
a - slope of the model y~x
Create variable result as data.frame:

result <- data.frame(sdX=sdX, sdY=sdY, cXY=cXY, a=a)  
Write the result to a file:

write.table(result, file = paste(dataPath,'result.csv',sep = '/'), row.names = F)
