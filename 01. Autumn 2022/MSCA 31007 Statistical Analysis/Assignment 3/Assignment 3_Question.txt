Download your uniform(0,1) sample from left sidebar, unpack and read it.

Create variable dataPath equal to path to your local folder where you saved the data file Week3_Test_Sample.csv.
It should look like:

dataPath<-"C:/Your path"
Note that in R path is specified with forward slash “/”. Do not end the path with / when you assign dataPath.

Read the data.

dat <- read.table(paste(dataPath,'Week3_Test_Sample.csv',sep = '/'), header=TRUE)
The sample dat has the following format:

dat$x[1] - mean value of normal distribution;
dat$x[2] - standard deviation of normal distribution;
dat$x[3] - intensity of exponential distribution;
dat$x[4]:dat$x[503] sample from uniform distribution on [0.1].
Using this sample, create:

Sample datNorm from normal distribution with mean dat$x[1] and standard deviation dat$x[2];
Sample datExp from exponential distribution with intensity dat$x[3].
Create matrix res with the two samples:

res<-cbind(datNorm=datNorm,datExp=datExp)
Save res to a file and upload the file using left sidebar.

write.table(res, file = paste(dataPath,'result.csv',sep = '/'), row.names = F)
