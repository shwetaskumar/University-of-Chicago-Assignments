Download your personal sample from left sidebar, unpack and read it:

dataPath <- "C:/path_to_your_dir/"
test_dat <- read.table(paste(dataPath,'Week9_Test_Sample.csv',sep = '/'), header=TRUE)
The sample test_dat has the following format:

test_dat$Resp - response values;
test_dat$Pred1 - predictor 1 values;
test_dat$Pred2 - predictor 2 values;
test_dat$Pred3 - predictor 3 values;
test_dat$Pred4 - predictor 4 values;
test_dat$Pred5 - predictor 5 values;
test_dat$Pred6 - predictor 6 values;
test_dat$Pred7 - predictor 7 values;
test_dat$Pred8 - predictor 8 values;
test_dat$Pred9 - predictor 9 values;
test_dat$Pred10 - predictor 10 values.
On the interactive tab, try to select predictors for the model by maximizing R^2 and/or minimizing AIC.

Fit the model with original predictors replaced by principal components as in week 9 workshop.
Select necessary principal components (factors) to satisfy the questions of the quiz.

Answer the quiz


QUIZ:
