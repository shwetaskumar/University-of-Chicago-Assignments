There are a few database modeling techniques (e.g. crowfoot, Chen, UML etc.).

Describe each of them briefly (crowfoot, Chen, UML), and explain which one do you prefer and why?

Also how industry follows these principles?

And lastly find a standard industry model (any industry of your choice e.g. health, insurance, banking, travel, etc.) on the internet and share the link with the class.
