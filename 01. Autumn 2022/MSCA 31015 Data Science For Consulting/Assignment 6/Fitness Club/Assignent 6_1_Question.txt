Predictive Model Exercise: 

Continuing with the dataset “Fitness Club” that was introduced in Week 4, this week your assignment is to perform the following actions with the data. 

Calculate basic stats descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for each field 
Visualize distributions of data elements using histograms for key variables and predict which variables you expect to be most correlated with default/churn. 
Build a Logistic Regression Model to Predict Churn/Retention, you may choose to identify groups within the data to narrow your focus on. (The "default" variable = churn, you may choose to only use age and payment type to build a model to predict "default" = churn) 
Display the output visually using charts of your choosing and explain your choice. (ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Gains Table) 
In addition to the spreadsheet/code or programming output you submit, include a separate written document of 250-500 words that summarizes your process. 
Discuss why certain variables you expected to be significant are/are not and any other unexpected insights.
This assignment is designed to expose you to models and tools the more advanced analyst uses to predict and develop business cases for action. You may need help from a tutor or by watching videos to understand enough to build your first logistic regression model. Experiment with this and make the attempt - even if it is a bit new and uncomfortable.  

We suggest you use Python, R or other tools you are comfortable with. Upload your final deliverable in a notebook or HTML file that is readable for evaluation.
