But I'm not planning on missing out on AAPL and today was a perfect day to lock in a bet. Unfortunately for me I got greedy and subsequently got slapped on the wrist.Position Bought an OTM straddle with intentions on selling right before earnings. This way I don't care about the results and ride the volatility wave up to the wave's crest.* BTO AAPL May put @ 525 for $10.10* BTO AAPL May call @ 665 $7.60It was poorly timed, because I tried to time the swings today hoping to trap some profits inside of the straddle . I bought the call during a price dip and I waited for prices to go back up before buying the put, which never really happened. That said, I . Any other AAPL takers?   \n",

I've been waiting a couple weeks for a good opportunity, and this looks like it may be it. Lot of buzz going around the company for their drug Qnexa potentially being approved by the FDA, and a couple sources even went as far as to call it \"an easy double\".I'll be honest, I'm completely new to this, and my sole decision to jump in on this stock is for the potential big ups that will happen today or tomorrow on that announcement plus the hype from around the web on it, then I'll be getting back out. I'll also be selling to cut losses if I need to as well.Thoughts?   \n",
